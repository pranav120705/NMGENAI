# 🧠 Generative AI Lab Exercise & Projects

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of **Generative AI** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** projects developed using tools like **LangChain**, **Transformers**, **Google Colab**, and open-source foundation models. These projects showcase applications in text generation, translation, image and video synthesis, sentiment analysis, chatbots, and multimodal reasoning.

## 🚀 Project Highlights

### 🗣️ Natural Language Processing
- NLP pipelines for tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition.
- Sentiment analysis using pre-trained transformer-based classifiers.
- Language translation using sequence-to-sequence architectures.

### 🤖 Conversational AI & Chatbots
- Chatbots that retrieve answers from Wikipedia and PDFs.
- Document-aware chat agents using LangChain and vector stores.
- Resume parsing and recommendation using LLM-powered tools.

### 🎨 Generative AI Applications
- Story generation from text prompts using large language models.
- Text summarization of long documents using transformers.
- Text-to-image generation via diffusion models.
- Conceptual text-to-video workflows using multimodal generative architectures.

### 📊 Model Exploration & Learning
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for synthetic data creation.
- Implementation and visualization of diffusion models.
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for cross-modal intelligence.
